# Project Introduction #

SimpleLatLng is a Java implementation of common latitude and longitude calculations. It is aimed at being quick to learn and easy to use for basic geo-spatial needs. You shouldn't need to write, test, and debug your own geo-spatial tools when this is a fairly common need in many applications.

Take a look at GettingStarted for a brief intro.
