# Road Map #

I have one guiding principle with this library: keep it simple. That's why it's in the name. Features are great, but features at the expense of clarity are not great.

That being said there are a few things that I would like to implement in SimpleLatLng:

  1. The option to calculate distances on a non-spherical Earth approximation for better accuracy.
  1. The option to adjust the internal precision of latitude and longitude values as a config setting. For some, a millionth of a degree might be too much or too little.
  1. Ever expanding and more complete unit testing (of course).
  1. Your suggestions!

Please feel free to contact me and/or create an enhancement request in the project Issues.
